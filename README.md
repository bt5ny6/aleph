aleph is an attempt at a properly made metaverse based on the voxel game engine minetest
the idea began in 2021 when i was just chill while the whole NFT bubble started and visited
some somewhat dissapointing "attempts" if you could even call them that, at a metaverse
and so i figured why not make it in minecraft, well fast forward to 2023 i was done with
minecraft and every limitation it put on me and how rotten the code was and how little it
could change, so i looked up and found minetest, and so i started planing what and how to 
do what i wanted to do so by now, late september 2024 i am finally starting to actively
develop this fork 

first of all i will state, when the official release is done for the quest plataform
there will be a required subscription *1 dolar per month* to use voicechat, text chat
and other forms of comunication, this is in order to be able to finance the servers and
a plausible automated age moderation system that could happen sometime in the future
but for now, its just an idea i have to skip the worst part of what other "metaverse's"
have, now onto a higher note

bypassing this will be easy if disabled on community servers and shared local worlds
and shared local worlds are what was blockman go or multiplayer master, worlds that
you hosted and other players from arround you or the whole world could join with no
unecesary 3rd party apps, i was a player of those services and i miss being able to 
just chill in a random minecraft p.e world that some dude hosted 


and at last the game is meant to be played either in vr, android, or pc
compilation for game consoles is hard and i dont want to have anything to do with 
them in any way so support for them is not to be expected for a near future

i plan to be able to put together the whole base game and put it on the quest platform
as soon as late 2025 so, for now, this note is all you see or know about this proyect
so for now, stay tunned!

Paths
-----
Locations:

* `bin`   - Compiled binaries
* `share` - Distributed read-only data
* `user`  - User-created modifiable data

Where each location is on each platform:

* Windows .zip / RUN_IN_PLACE source:
    * `bin`   = `bin`
    * `share` = `.`
    * `user`  = `.`
* Windows installed:
    * `bin`   = `C:\Program Files\Minetest\bin (Depends on the install location)`
    * `share` = `C:\Program Files\Minetest (Depends on the install location)`
    * `user`  = `%APPDATA%\Minetest` or `%MINETEST_USER_PATH%`
* Linux installed:
    * `bin`   = `/usr/bin`
    * `share` = `/usr/share/minetest`
    * `user`  = `~/.minetest` or `$MINETEST_USER_PATH`
* macOS:
    * `bin`   = `Contents/MacOS`
    * `share` = `Contents/Resources`
    * `user`  = `Contents/User` or `~/Library/Application Support/minetest` or `$MINETEST_USER_PATH`

Worlds can be found as separate folders in: `user/worlds/`

Configuration file
------------------
- Default location:
    `user/minetest.conf`
- This file is created by closing Minetest for the first time.
- A specific file can be specified on the command line:
    `--config <path-to-file>`
- A run-in-place build will look for the configuration file in
    `location_of_exe/../minetest.conf` and also `location_of_exe/../../minetest.conf`

Command-line options
--------------------
- Use `--help`

Version scheme
--------------
We use `major.minor.patch` since 5.0.0-dev. Prior to that we used `0.major.minor`.

- Major is incremented when the release contains breaking changes, all other
numbers are set to 0.
- Minor is incremented when the release contains new non-breaking features,
patch is set to 0.
- Patch is incremented when the release only contains bugfixes and very
minor/trivial features considered necessary.

Since 5.0.0-dev and 0.4.17-dev, the dev notation refers to the next release,
i.e.: 5.0.0-dev is the development version leading to 5.0.0.
Prior to that we used `previous_version-dev`.
